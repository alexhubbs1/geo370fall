<h1>Homework 8: Census data ratios and categories </h1>
<h2>Alex Hubbs</h2>
<h3>The ratio that I chose to represent my data is the number of people who are living in poverty for every 1000 people living in each county in North Dakota. I feel like this gives the map reader a clear understanding of where the poverty in North Dakota is most prevalent, rather than just plain percentages. I chose to make the ratio out of 1000 because many counties in North Dakota have very small populations so this gives a rather accurate view on the situation. </h3>

<h2>Pros and Cons of the Classifications</h2>
    <h3>The classification that is the most useful is Natural Breaks, as this mode has each of the counties spread out in data ranges that clearly seperate the worst counties from the best, in terms of poverty. The Equal Interval mode perhaps does this too much as it has barely any counties in the darker shades, since the upper ranges are so narrow. This makes it appear like these few counties are the only ones experiencing any poverty, when in reality this is not the case. The equal count mode also is not very good at conveying the data since the top data range is more than twice the size of all the others combined. This classification makes the poverty look much worse than is really is. </h3>
