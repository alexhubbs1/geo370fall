<h1>Homework 7: Census data choropleth </h1>
<h2>Alex Hubbs</h2>
<h3>This map shows an estimation of the number of people living in poverty in each county in North Dakota. The county with the most people under poverty level is Cass County with 18,179. The city of Fargo is the reason that there are so many people living in poverty in this county, as it is the most populous city in the state. Other counties with high poverty numbers are Burleigh county, where the state capitol, Bismarck, is located and Grand Forks counties, which houses the city of Grand Forks. </h3>
