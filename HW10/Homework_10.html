<h1>Homework 10: Geoprocessing Analysis </h1>
<h3>Alex Hubbs</h3>
<h2>How much of Charlotte's most impoverished areas are in range of Charlotte Douglas International Airport's noise pollution?</h2>
<h3>I chose to examine the relationship between where people under the poverty level are living and the noise pollution caused by Charlotte's airport. I thought that the land surrounding the may have a cheaper value due to the constant noise that is caused by the hundreds of flights that fly in and out of the airport on a daily basis. I used a data set that showed the airport's noise overlay and then added a buffer of one mile since this area would still experience major noise pollution. I then found a data set that showed poverty levels within different block groups and eliminated all of the block groups with poverty rates less that 25% in order to show the most impoverished areas of the city. I then did an intersection between the two layers to see how much of the noise polluted area was inhabited by an impoverished population. I found that while some of Charlotte's most impoverished regions are within the range of the airport noise, there is no clear correlation.  </h3>
