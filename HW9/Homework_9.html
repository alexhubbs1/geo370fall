<h1>Homework 9: Make a Cloropleth or Proportional Symbol Map </h1>
<h2>Alex Hubbs</h2>
<h3>The ratio that I chose to represent my data is the number of people who are living in poverty for every 1000 people living in each county in North Dakota. I feel like this gives the map reader a clear understanding of where the poverty in North Dakota is most prevalent, rather than just plain percentages. I chose to make the ratio out of 1000 because many counties in North Dakota have very small populations so this gives a rather accurate view on the situation. </h3>
