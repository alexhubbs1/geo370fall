<h1>Homework 9: Make a Cloropleth or Proportional Symbol Map </h1>
<h2>Alex Hubbs</h2>
<h3>The data that I chose to display with my cloropleth map is the number of McDonalds located in each state per each state's population. I then multiplied this ratio by 100,000 to make the data easier to understand. This means that my map is showing how many McDonalds there are in each state per 100,000 people. One thing that I noticed it that many states the upper Mid-West/ Great Lakes region have a high amount of McDonalds(4.47-5.46) per 100,000 people. This is very interesting since only a few other states thoughout the United States have this high of a ratio. I chose this topic because I thought it would be interesting to look at the distribution of one of the largest fast food chains in the United States.</h3>
